**👋Hi, I'm Robert L Walker IV**

I'm an Industrial Engineer who's interested in transitioning into a career in Data Science. I am an innovative problem-solver with a passion for continuous improvement and optimization through data analysis and lean methodologies. I began my journey into Data Science through the **University of Tennessee's** Industrial and Information Engineering undergraduate program where I studied Operations Research and other Statistics Methodologies in great detail. I've sense expounded on that foundation by attending **Vanderbilt University’s Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp** where I developed a foundation in numerous coding languages such as Python, R, SQL, Java, and many more. I have a keen interest in manipulating large data sets, driving process improvement initiatives, designing, building, and deploying machine learning applications, as well as writing.

Outside of work, I enjoy...

* 🎧 Listening to all types of music and DJing (Follow me @ DJ HTR on SoundCloud)

* 🤸 Crossfit - my preferred style of exercise

* 📚 Reading

* 🃏 Playing Yu-Gi-Oh TCG 

* 🏀⚾🏈 Daily Fantasy Sports
